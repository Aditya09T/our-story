      "On 6th March 2022 at 10:30 AM, while playing truth-or-dare with friends, Puchu (Aditya) was pushed to speak his heart. He leaned close and whispered, \"I love you.\"",
      "Her friends nudged her as well — and she whispered, \"I love you.\" From that moment they became a pair.",
      "They met in Class 8, became close friends in Class 9 and then became partners in Class 10. They studied together, laughed together, and supported each other.",
      "After Class 10, they continued together into Class 11–12 (science stream) at Bishalgarh English Medium HS School, completed Class 12 in March 2024, then moved forward with college and careers while staying by each other's side."
