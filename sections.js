    story: `On 3rd March 2022 at 10:30 AM, while playing truth-or-dare with friends, Puchu (Aditya) was nudged to speak his heart. He whispered in Golu's ear, "I love you." Her friends pushed her too — and she whispered back, "I love you." From that moment they became a pair. That day began everything: exams, classes, laughter, and a promise to stay together.`,
